# tkinter-quiz-project

I developed a quiz game using the Python module Tkinter where the user can choose between an addition, subtraction, multiplication and division quiz and its number of questions. They can also redo previous quizzes and view the quizzes with the 5 highest scores. All of this is presented using a Graphical User Interface coded using Tkinter.
